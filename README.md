# go-filepursuit
Filepursuit API Golang practice project based on PRO version of the FilePursuit APK

### Note about discover function
* Use query `""` to get results that would resemble the main page in the app
* Use the link of an entry you want to discover further
* If fileType = `"-"` it is a folder that can be further explored

### Note to API owner
This API is in dire need of cryptographic securing, while reversing this API I noticed a surprising lack of any kind of security.
If you want some pointers from someone who is into reverse engineering as to how to properly secure the API, just get in contact with me and I will lay out some ideas that would be compatible with your PHP server-side and java client-side.

### Future of this project
I don't plan on maintaining this project. 

Use at your own risk.
